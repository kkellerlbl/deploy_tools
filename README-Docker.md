# Deploying with docker

## Create a site config.

    cp site.cfg.example site.cfg
    # edit site.cfg

## Acquire the images

    # get rtmin
    docker pull mysql:5.5
    docker pull mongo:2.4


## Create a config file, and a tag file for the versions.  This determines what version of services will be deployed.

    ./scripts/generate_config
    ./deploy_cluster mkhashfile tagfile

## Build images
Make sure kbase/rtmin is available. This is provide by a branch in the bootstrap repo.

    docker build -t kbase/deplbase:1.0 -f Dockerfile.base .
    docker build -t kbase/depl:1.0 .
    ./scripts/build_narrative

## Run the bootstrap script to start things up

    ./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Detailed steps

These steps are done by the bootstrap.  Advanced users may need to run some steps separately.

## Create self-signed certs or copy in certs to ./ssl.  Create the config from the docker template.

    ./scripts/create_certs

## Create a tag file for the versions.  This determines what version of services will be deployed.

    ./deploy_cluster mkhashfile tagfile



## Start Base services

Start Mongo and mysql

    docker run --name mongo -d mongo:2.4
    docker run --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql:5.5

## Initialize Databases

## Start services

Clone kbrouter and use it to start things up

    git clone https://github.com/KBaseIncubator/kbrouter
    cd kbrouter
    cp ../cluster.ini cluster.ini
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d
    curl http://localhost:8080/services/shock-api
    curl http://localhost:8080/services/awe-api
